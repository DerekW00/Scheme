# Scheme

This project develops an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.

The subset of the language used in this project is described in the functional programming section of Composing Programs. Since this project only includes a subset of the language, the interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.

Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. This project includes some small programs impletemented in Scheme to show how Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.
